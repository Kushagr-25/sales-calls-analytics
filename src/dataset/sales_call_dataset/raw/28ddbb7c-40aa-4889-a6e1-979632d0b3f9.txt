Customer (henryrebecca): That sounds useful, but how does it work exactly? Is it complicated to set up?

Agent (khanson): Not at all, Henry. Our chatbot platform is user-friendly. We handle all the setup and integration for you. Once in place, you can customize responses and train it to understand your specific business needs.

Customer (henryrebecca): Customize how? And does it understand different accents or colloquialisms?

Vargas: Great choicesâ€”they're popular features. Our ProHeart model is excellent for heart rate monitoring. It also gives insights on sleep quality. Would you like to know about the price and warranty?

Joseph: Yes, please. And are there any ongoing discounts or promotions for new customers?

Vargas: Absolutely. For new customers, we offer a 10% discount. And don't worry, our ProHeart comes with a two-year warranty.

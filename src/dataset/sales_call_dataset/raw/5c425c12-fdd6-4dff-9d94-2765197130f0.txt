Agent: Good morning, Thompson Sales, this is fmunoz speaking. How may I assist you today?

Customer: Morning, um, I'm not sure if I'm subscribed to your CRM yet but I was looking at your product last week. Do you have it?

Agent: Yes, Mr. Taylor, we do offer a full SaaS CRM subscription here at Fusion. Did you have any questions about the plans?

Customer: I'm interested, particularly about the pricing and what features are included.

Agent: Certainly! Our plans start at $29 per user per month. They include contact management, sales forecasting, automated follow-ups, and much more.

Customer: Automated follow-ups sound useful, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you tell me more about the basic plan?

Agent: Absolutely. The Basic Plan includes email templates, contact management, and basic analytics at $19 per user per month

Customer (leah30): Hi, this is Leah. I'm interested in your premium credit card offerings. Can you provide some details?
Agent (matthew35): Of course, Leah! Our premium credit card offers 0% interest on purchases for the first 12 months, a generous welcome bonus, and extensive travel benefits. Would you like to hear more about the welcome bonus or travel perks?

I'm reaching out to discuss our AI-powered chatbot plan that's ideal for businesses looking to streamline customer service. May I ask which industry your business operates in? Customer: Hi Kimpaula, thanks for the call. I run a small online retail store selling handmade crafts. Agent: That sounds wonderful! Our chatbot can help you handle customer inquiries effectively, and it's especially good at managing high volumes of traffic since your store operates online. May I ask what stage you're currently at with your customer service strategy? Customer: I'm really focusing on improving response times, but I'm worried about the investment cost. Agent: I completely understand your concerns, Danathomas. Our plan offers a scalable solution that starts with basic features at a cost-effective price, ensuring that you don't overspend. Once we tailor the chatbot to your needs, we continuously monitor and adjust to provide the best performance. Customer: Okay, that sounds promising
